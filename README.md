# spotatube
Spotatube is a little script made for personal use quite long time ago, it
may or may not work - it does on my setup though.  
It is supposed to be bound to some key-combination (all DM should have such option).
Personally I use Ctrl+Alt+Shift+P.

# Features
It can find links to YouTube search page and directly to first Youtube result.
Link can be opened automatically and/or copied to clipboard.

# License
